# Granger Causality Analysis

## Overview

This C++ code provides a tool for performing Granger causality analysis on multivariate statistical data. Granger causality is a statistical technique used to assess whether one time series variable can help predict another, which can provide valuable insights into potential causal relationships.

## Features

- **Multivariate Granger Causality**: Evaluate Granger causality for multiple time series variables simultaneously.
- **Statistical Testing**: Conduct statistical tests to determine the presence of predictive relationships between variables.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Handle time series data and assess temporal patterns to identify potential causal links.
- **Causal Inference**: While Granger causality assesses predictiveness rather than strict causation, the results can offer insights into causal relationships within your dataset.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the C++ code using your preferred compiler.
3. Prepare your multivariate time series data as input (format and data requirements may vary depending on your implementation).
4. Run the compiled executable with your data to perform Granger causality analysis.

**Note**: Granger causality analysis, as implemented in this code, can help identify predictive relationships in multivariate time series data, which can be a valuable step in causal inference. However, it is essential to interpret the results carefully and consider other evidence and methods when establishing causal relationships more rigorously.

For a deeper understanding of causal inference, you may want to explore additional causal inference techniques and approaches beyond Granger causality.
